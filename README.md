## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment support (venv)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndersHsueh/TeamDev.git
cd TeamDev
```

### 2. Create Python 3.10 Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your configuration
# Add API keys, database connections, etc.
```

### 5. Database Setup
```bash
# Initialize database
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from teamdev import AITeam, Project

# Initialize AI team
team = AITeam()

# Create a new project
project = Project("my-web-app", language="python", framework="flask")

# Let the AI team work on it
team.assign_project(project)
team.start_development()
```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
# Start the TeamDev platform
python main.py

# Access web interface at http://localhost:8000
```
